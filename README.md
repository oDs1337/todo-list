## Another todo-list - [ods1337.github.io/todo-list](https://ods1337.github.io/todo-list)

Stack:
-Angular
-TypeScript
-NgRx
-RxJs
-Angular Material
-Loopback as API server
-MongoDB as database

Based on my previous projects I've made to do list using: modules, components (routing inside modules and lazy load modules in main routing file).
State is managed by NgRx, subscriptions are made on init and unsibscribed on destroy (RxJs), then data is sent to Loopback server (API) which is pushing it towards MongoDB cloud.
UI is made in Angular Material.
